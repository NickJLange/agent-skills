# Jargon Detection & Decoding

Detects and translates domain-specific jargon (acronyms, technical terms, out-of-distribution words) in digest content. Each term is classified by theme (from unified-digest-themes taxonomy) and sophistication level, with plainspeak translations at multiple reading levels.

## The Jargon Registry

The master dictionary lives at [references/jargon-registry.json](references/jargon-registry.json). Each entry has:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `term` | The jargon word/acronym (key in JSON, e.g. "DPO") |
| `theme` | Theme from unified-digest-themes taxonomy |
| `sub_theme` | Optional sub-theme for AI & ML Research items |
| `source_level` | Highest sophistication level where it originates |
| `plainspeak.doctor` | Domain-expert explanation (full technical precision) |
| `plainspeak.high-school` | Tech-literate generalist explanation |
| `plainspeak.kindergarten` | General audience explanation (short, intuitive) |
| `first_seen` | ISO date first encountered |
| `last_seen` | ISO date most recently seen |
| `seen_in` | Array of source identifiers (e.g. "arxiv:cs.CL", "x:list-ai-high-signal") |

### Sophistication Levels

| Level | Audience | Example ("DPO") |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| doctor | Domain experts | "Direct preference optimization using pairwise preferences to align language models with human values" |
| high-school | Tech-literate generalists | "Training AI by showing it which outputs are better and letting it learn from comparisons" |
| kindergarten | General audience | "Teaching AI right from wrong by example" |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load registry

Read `references/jargon-registry.json` via skill_view(name='jargon', file_path='references/jargon-registry.json') to get known terms. The registry persists across sessions — always load the latest.

### Step 2: Scan content for known jargon

For each digest item (paper title/abstract, tweet, story headline):
- Check if any registered term appears (case-insensitive match)
- **Skip saturated terms**: if a term has `"saturated": true` in the registry, do NOT include it in the jargon output. These are baseline terms the audience already knows (e.g. LLM, SFT). They still count as "detected" for tracking purposes (update last_seen) but do not appear in the digest.
- For non-saturated terms found, include the definition LABELED with the education level: `🎒 [kindergarten] TERM = definition`
- Within a single digest, track which terms have already been explained and skip repeats. If LLM was explained in paper 1, don't re-explain it in paper 7.
- Use kindergarten level for general-audience channels, high-school for technical channels, doctor for expert-only channels

### Step 3: Detect unknown jargon

For unfamiliar capitalized acronyms (3-8 chars written in ALL CAPS) or domain-specific terms not in the registry:
- Infer theme from context using unified-digest-themes taxonomy
- Generate a plainspeak definition at all three levels using available local model or reasoning
- Append a note with level label: `🆕 New term: TERM = [kindergarten-level definition]`

### Step 4: Update registry

For newly confirmed terms (verify with the user or infer from context):
- Read the registry file via skill_view
- Add a new entry with all required fields
- Write via skill_manage write_file to update the reference

## Output in Digests

When jargon is detected in a digest item, append the plainspeak note with an education level label. Saturated terms (those the audience already knows) are suppressed — they never appear in output even if detected in the text. Within a single digest, each term is explained at most once (on first encounter).

For known non-saturated terms:

```
**Jargon:** 🎒 [kindergarten] DPO = teaching AI right from wrong by example. LLM = a smart computer brain that understands words.
```

For newly detected terms found during this run:

```
**Jargon:** 🆕 New term: BPE = a common way to split words into smaller pieces. LM = a computer model that understands language.
```

Group multiple jargon notes on the same `**Jargon:**` line if many terms appear in one paper. Separate entries with periods. Use kindergarten level for general-audience channels, high-school for technical channels.

## Registry Maintenance

- New terms are discovered during digest runs (Step 3)
- The registry grows organically — there is no "complete" list
- Terms marked `"saturated": true` are never displayed to the audience (suppressed from all digest output), but they remain in the registry for tracking. Mark common baseline terms as saturated when they appear so often that re-explaining them adds noise.
- Periodically consolidate: if a term hasn't been seen in 90 days, flag for possible removal
- First seen/last seen dates enable usage tracking over time

## Version History

- 1.2.0 (2026-06-14): Added saturation filter — terms marked `"saturated": true` are suppressed from digest output. Added per-digest deduplication to avoid re-explaining the same term across multiple papers in one run.
