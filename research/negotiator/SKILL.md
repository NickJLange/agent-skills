# Negotiator Skill

This skill assists agents in running mobile-friendly pricing comparisons and negotiation target bid spreadsheets for target vehicles.

## When to Use
Use this skill when the user provides a VIN or a specific quote for a vehicle (e.g. at a dealership with options) and wants to:
1. Compare that price with other regional listings.
2. Establish a clear negotiation gap against similar units.
3. Compute midpoint (50% spread) and aggressive (10% below market) target bids for phone/email pitches.

## Setup & Credentials

To run the negotiator tool, you need to configure the following environment variables or add them to your `.env` file:
*   `VISOR.VIN_API_KEY` (or `VISOR_API_KEY`): Required. The bearer API token used to query the live Visor API for real-time inventory listings.

## Dependencies

This skill requires the following Python libraries:
*   `requests`
*   `python-dotenv`

## How to Run

Execute the tool via Python:

```bash
python scripts/negotiator_tool.py --price <QUOTED_PRICE> [ --vin <VIN> ] [ --make <MAKE> --model <MODEL> --trim <TRIM> ]
```

### Parameters
*   `--price`: (Required) The current quoted price of the vehicle.
*   `--vin`: (Optional) The 17-digit VIN. If supplied, the tool decodes it to determine the make/model/trim.
*   `--make`: (Optional) The vehicle make (e.g., Toyota, Lexus, Chrysler).
*   `--model`: (Optional) The vehicle model (e.g., Grand Highlander, Pacifica, TX).
*   `--trim`: (Optional) The trim level (e.g., Pinnacle AWD, Hybrid MAX Platinum AWD).

## Example Output

The script outputs two tables formatted inside a markdown block that fit perfectly on mobile screens:

1.  **Quote vs. Benchmarks**: Compares the quoted OTD against the cheapest comparable unit found in the database, and against our baseline target vehicles (Pacifica, Grand Highlander, Lexus TX).
2.  **Negotiation Bid Targets**: Outlines specific, actionable price bids:
    *   **Midpoint (50% Spread)**: The halfway point between the dealer's quote and the cheapest market price.
    *   **Cheapest Market (100%)**: The lowest price listed in the market for this exact trim.
    *   **Aggressive (-10% Market)**: 10% below the cheapest market price, useful for low-balling or initiating a tough push.

## Post-Sale Warranty (VSC) & Protection Contacts

Reference these contacts post-purchase to secure official manufacturer extended warranties at wholesale or heavily discounted pricing.

### 1. Toyota Grand Highlander & Lexus Configurations
Toyota and Lexus share the same corporate backing (Toyota Motor Insurance Services). These high-volume finance managers can write official factory policies for both brands:
*   **The Contact**: Jerry Johnson at Midwest Superstore (Hutchinson, KS).
    *   *Why he's famous*: "Jerry from Midwest" is a household name across Toyota and Lexus forums. He sells official Toyota/Lexus Platinum VSCs at a fraction of standard retail.
    *   *How to reach him*: Email directly at jerryj@midwestsuperstore.com or call the dealership at 800-530-5789.
*   **The Alternative**: Troy Dietrich at Factory Discount Warranty (backed by a brick-and-mortar Toyota network in MA).
    *   *How to reach him*: Submit a quote request through fd-warranty.com.
*   *Note*: You can purchase these plans anytime up until the original 3-year / 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper factory warranty expires.

### 2. Chrysler Pacifica
For a Pacifica, purchase an official Mopar MaxCare plan (the highest tier component coverage directly from Stellantis). Do not accept a third-party plan:
*   **The Contact**: Tom Winkels at LaFontaine CDJR (formerly Hayes Jeep).
    *   *Why he's famous*: Tom is the undisputed "low-margin king" for Mopar warranties across the internet. He sells authentic Mopar Vehicle Protection plans at wholesale volume margins.
    *   *How to reach him*: Email at tomwinkels@hayescars.com or contact the dealership's finance department.
*   **The Online Portal Option**: Zeigler Auto Group (chryslerfactoryplans.com).
    *   *Why they're famous*: Zeigler is a massive dealer group with an automated online checkout for official Mopar plans.
    *   *The trick*: Use online forum promo codes (often `PAYINFULL` or `DAMON`) to instantly cut an extra $300 to $500 off the quote.
